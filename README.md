📌 Course Information

Course Title: Web Engineering

Program: B.Sc. Software Engineering

Instructor: Dr. Shamila Nasreen

University: Mirpur University of Science and Technology (MUST)

Assignment: Examination Assignment-2 (CEP)

📖 Project Overview

This project evaluates the performance, usability, and accessibility of two web applications using modern web auditing tools.
The purpose is to identify performance bottlenecks, accessibility issues, and propose improvements based on industry standards.

🌍 Evaluated Websites

SparkReceipt
🔗 https://www.sparkreceipt.com

A commercial web application for managing digital receipts.

Gym Website
🔗 https://hira-0534.github.io/gym-website/

A static website developed using HTML and CSS showcasing gym services.

🛠 Tools Used

Google Lighthouse

PageSpeed Insights

Chrome DevTools

📊 Performance Summary
Website	Performance	Accessibility	Best Practices	SEO
Gym Website	98	97	96	91
SparkReceipt	29	86	77	92
♿ Accessibility Summary
Metric	Gym Website	SparkReceipt
Accessibility Score	97/100	86/100
Keyboard Navigation	Good	Moderate
Alt Text for Images	Some missing	Several missing
Color Contrast	Good	Needs improvement
🧑‍💻 Usability Summary (Observed)
Website	Usability Score	Remarks
Gym Website	96/100	Simple navigation, fast response, consistent design
SparkReceipt	77/100	Feature-rich but slow performance affects usability

Note: Lighthouse does not provide a direct usability score. Usability was evaluated based on performance behavior, accessibility, navigation clarity, and UI consistency.

🚀 Key Findings

Gym Website shows excellent performance and accessibility

SparkReceipt needs performance optimization

Accessibility issues mainly include color contrast and ARIA labels

Heavy JavaScript affects responsiveness on SparkReceipt

✅ Recommendations

Optimize images using modern formats (WebP)

Minify and defer non-critical JavaScript and CSS

Enable browser caching

Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, color contrast, heading order)
